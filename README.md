🌐 [繁體中文](./README.zh-TW.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

Have you ever encountered a prompt saying “Please disable USB debugging” while using banking or financial apps?
UsbDebugShortcut is a tool designed to solve this annoying issue. It provides a simple way to quickly turn USB debugging on or off, helping you manually handle these limitations.

## Features
- Quickly toggle USB debugging (requires root access)
- Shortcut available even without root – redirects to Developer Options
- Helps you quickly access settings to manually disable USB debugging
- No ads, no internet required – safe and secure

## Use Cases
- When financial or government apps require USB debugging to be turned off
- Developers or testers who frequently toggle USB debugging
- Save time by avoiding navigating deep into system settings

## Notes
- This app does not collect any personal data; all operations are local to your device.
- One-tap toggle requires root access.
- Non-root devices can still quickly jump to Developer Options to manually adjust settings.
- This app will NOT bypass detection limitations automatically; users still need to manually disable USB debugging.
